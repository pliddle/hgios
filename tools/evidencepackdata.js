        "what_text": "\"The Ambassadors programme started around 2018. Discussions around every day leadership and the meaning of leadership roles led the school to make a bold change: the removal of captain roles, replaced by \"\"ambassador\"\" roles. Over time these roles have matched into the work of departments and areas of the school. The roles have evolved to meet the needs of young people in the school with ambassadors focus on support for learning, wellbeing, extra-curricular opportunities, transition, digital skills, and many other areas of practice.\n\n\n\nThe work of Ambassador development started when a small group of pupils attended East Dunbartonshire Council training on Augmented and Alternative Communication. The effect on the young people was profound - one young person changed their UCAS application in order to focus on Educational Psychology rather than their original Science-based pathway. Two of the team had applied for captaincy roles and had been unsuccessful - an indication, perhaps, that the system wasn't reflecting the value of the work.\n\n\n\nOver the following years, pupils and staff identified roles, invented new roles, and were awarded badges to recognise their place in the leadership of the schools. Ambassadors have contributed to the school in a multitude of ways, including:\n\n\n\n- Event planning and organising - discos, proms, charity events.\n\n- Supporting young people in class on a one to one and whole class level\n\n- Visiting and working with young people in primary school through digital learning, sports, reading and languages\n\n- Supporting wellbeing through wellbeing focused clubs, and highlighting positive mental health strategies through assemblies\n\n- Led the development of a charities committee that reflects the views and supportive actions of the community \n\n- Represented the school at events and organised teams to support young people at events\n\n- Run extra curricular opportunities including sports coaching, science and engineering clubs\n\n- Supported staff and pupils as digital ambassadors with online homework tools and Glow, including supporting parents\n\n- Supporting the school library\n\n- Supporting language development in class and with individual pupils\n\n- Supporting Young Enterprise competitions and events in school\n\n\n\nA particular achievement has been the impactful work of peer mentor support in Mathematics and Chemistry, where young people support students in the years below to study - in the form of classroom support and interventions.\"",

In S4, National 5 results are ahead of comparators when looking at success in 5 or more N5s, and within the majority of departments. In 2024, half of subjects in S4 were significantly ahead of their course comparator in Insight and most subjects have positive results for most years in the last 5 years.\n\nNational 5 and Higher results have continually improved over the last three years and have sustained, high levels of A passes and overall pass rates. Presentation rates are consistently higher in major subjects such as English and Maths than other schools in the Local Authority. Where schools are meeting with a similar level of results, Bearsden Academy adds more “value added” versus the Virtual Comparator than similar schools.\n\nA significant percentage of pupils – 50% of S4 roll in 2025 – achieve at least one Advanced Higher, peaking in 2023 with 54%. \n\nInsight data shows that leavers and S4-S6 cohorts achieve above Virtual Comparators, Local Authority and National measures over time, particularly when looking at complementary tariff points, due to the high uptake of SQA qualifications for young people.\n\nSenior leaders in the school are able to analyse the results each year to find clear strengths and areas for development, producing detailed breakdowns for the local authority, and finding ways to group small cohort data (e.g. SIMD Q1) in order the draw conclusions.\n\nAn example of this analysis is the demonstration that over 5 years, average points for SIMD Q1 pupils is 112 points lower than Q5 pupils over that time – which is the lowest gap in the Local Authority. Also, in each year group, the lowest 20% of attainment has increased over time.\n\nAt department level, every Principal Teacher generates a report based on their own priorities, identifying areas of strength and development for their subjects. These are used to get an overall view of attainment and how it is achieved: importantly, all staff are involved in the meetings around attainment.\n\nInterventions over a session come via Guidance referrals, tracking meetings and an intervention programme. The collective effort of staff allows many pupils who were off track to gain a pass – a majority of those identified as borderline or failing post-prelim go on to pass at National 5 and Higher.\n\nThe drive for attainment requires autonomy for departments – this can be seen by the variety of interventions offered by teachers over a session – many of which sit outside of structures provided by Study Support.",

        "what_text": "Bearsden Academy’s curriculum is strategically designed to ensure high attainment and successful transition into positive post-school pathways. Its foundation is built firmly upon the 7 Principles of Curriculum Design and the 6 Learner Entitlements. We continually review our practice to ensure learning within the four contexts provides pupils with a wealth of opportunities, developing them as responsible citizens, confident individuals, effective contributors, and successful learners.  \n\nOur BGE curriculum is robustly designed around the Experiences and Outcomes up to and including the Fourth Level in all curricular areas of Curriculum for Excellence. We ensure courses provide relevant depth and challenge, supporting appropriately paced progression while prioritising enjoyment through diverse learning and teaching approaches.\n\n- Curriculum Foundations: The curriculum and associated learning experiences are shaped using the Principles and Practice papers alongside identified significant aspects of learning and progression frameworks.\n\n- Integrated Skills and Literacy: Literacy, numeracy, and health and wellbeing outcomes are deeply embedded across the BGE. Interdisciplinary learning opportunities are frequent, allowing pupils to make powerful connections in their learning. Crucially, Meta-skill development has been explicitly built into all BGE curricular planners.\n\n- Outdoor Learning and Creativity: We leverage outdoor learning opportunities to enhance engagement and broaden practical skills development. Our ability to respond quickly and creatively to pupil needs, particularly concerning the delivery of specialised curriculum, is a key strength that has been enhanced by recent staffing changes, allowing us to be highly flexible and innovative.\n\n- Curriculum Innovation (Recent BGE Examples): This responsive approach has led to creative curriculum developments in departments such as PE (Creative Curriculum) and English (Creative Industries focus) (see supporting evidence).\n\n- Personalisation in S2/S3: Learners have the opportunity to personalise their curriculum as they transition from S2 into S3. While continuing to cover all curricular areas, they gain the flexibility to make choices that reflect their interests, abilities, and aptitudes. We firmly believe this equips learners with the requisite skills and aptitudes for a successful transition to the Senior Phase.\n\nThe Senior Phase curriculum is designed to ensure our young people attain highly and meet their full potential, with strong pupil attainment being a key strength of the school. Students benefit from a broad suite of courses and qualifications to prepare them for life beyond Bearsden Academy.\n\n- Flexible Pathways and Proactive Departments: Our departments are proactive in shaping pupil options, ensuring that Senior Phase choices are continually adapting to reflect the evolving demands of the job market, further/higher education entry requirements, and the specific needs of our current school context.\n\n- Qualifications and Breadth: Students are typically presented for SQA qualifications in S4 (National 4/5), S5 (Higher, National 5), and S6 (Advanced Higher, further Higher, or National 5).\n\n- Enhanced Offerings: The curriculum is complemented by bespoke courses designed to add flexibility and the opportunity to access vocational courses through the East Dunbartonshire Council \"Senior Phase Partnership\" programme.\n\n- Curriculum Expansion (Recent Changes): Recent additions further enrich the offer, including Higher Dance and the Level 6 (L6) Mental Health course, addressing contemporary skills and wellbeing needs.\n\n- Preparation for Life: The totality of our Senior Phase curriculum rigorously prepares our young people, helping them develop Skills for Learning, Skills for Life, and Skills for Work.\n\nPupil voice is structurally embedded to ensure young people play a central role in shaping their experiences and school improvement. This is facilitated through:\n\n- Regular input built into departmental practice.\n\n- A whole-school focus via Quality Assurance Pupil Focus Groups.\n\n- Dedicated Pupil Improvement Teams.\n\nThe Senior Leadership Team (SLT) maintains critical, strategic oversight of the curriculum, ensuring its continuous relevance and effective delivery.\n\n- Annual Curriculum Planning Summit: Crucially, the SLT member with direct responsibility for the curriculum holds a dedicated planning meeting every August as a core component of the annual curriculum review and planning cycle.\n\n- Strategic Alignment: This meeting ensures that the implementation of all curricular developments—from BGE skills embedding to Senior Phase course flexibility—is strategically aligned with national policy, local authority priorities, and the school's commitment to the Curriculum Improvement Cycle (CIC).\n\nThis commitment ensures that curriculum decisions are not only operational but are driven by a high-level strategic vision for sustained pupil success and positive post-school pathways.\n\nOur commitment to partnership working significantly strengthens the curriculum and pupil pathways, ensuring families are engaged and expertise is leveraged across the school.\n\nWe actively build strong parent partnerships through strategic, high-impact engagement at crucial transition and decision-making points across a pupil's journey.\n\n- P7 Transition Events: Engaging families early to smooth the transition process and introduce the curriculum structure.\n\n- S1 Family Learning Events: Focusing on supporting family learning in the Broad General Education (BGE), ensuring parents understand how to reinforce key skills and subject learning at home.\n\n- S2 into S3 Options Evening: Providing clear guidance to families as pupils make their first major curriculum choices, linking subject selection to future pathways.\n\n- Senior Phase Engagement (S4/5/6): Dedicated parent engagement events that directly support informed subject choices and future planning within the Senior Phase.\n\nThese events are strategically reinforced by the Parent Partnership Database (introduced in 2024), which connects parental professional expertise directly to school events and curriculum design, enhancing real-world relevance.\n\nWe develop and maintain effective community partnerships to enhance learning, offering authentic real-world contexts and opportunities that extend the curriculum beyond the classroom, further enriching the overall pupil experience.\n\nA strategic focus on moderation across the school ensures consistency and quality in learning and teaching, embedding a clear cycle of continuous improvement into the curriculum:\n\nStaff CLPL and Toolkit: Moderation is built into the Learning and Teaching Toolkit, with staff CLPL delivered in May 2025 and follow-up CLPL workshops offered in August 2025.\n\nWorking Group and Events: A dedicated staff working group has been created to lead and coordinate three whole-school moderation events each academic year.\n\nReview and Support: Moderation evidence for each department is uploaded on a central Teams page. The working group reviews this evidence to identify best practice and implement effective follow-up support strategies post-moderation events, closing the quality assurance loop.\n\n",

Meta-skills are fully integrated into curriculum place-mat planners, creating strong coherence and a shared language around skills progression. Through this shared language, young people articulate their strengths and skills with confidence and demonstrating a strong understanding of how meta-skills relate to their learning, future pathways and everyday life.\n\n\n\nIn August 2024, we launched a comprehensive, whole-school Meta-Skills Toolkit to standardize and support the explicit teaching and application of skills. This toolkit provides core resources for every classroom, including A3 Display Posters that visually define the meta-skills and their conceptual groupings. The toolkit also features Flashcards for each skill, which are used to help pupils make direct connections between their learning activities and their evolving skills profile. Furthermore, staff are provided with subject-specific support materials such as differentiated lesson starters, finishers, and tasks, to ensure seamless integration across the curriculum.\n\n\n\nPSE has introduced the use of the SDS Meta-skills Profile to support young people in tracking skills development throughout their educational journey. \n\nDigital Meta-skills Badges, launched October 2025, allow staff to track, celebrate and recognise Meta skills developed/demonstrated in class/school context.\n\n\n\nThe school’s DYW and meta-skills curriculum is further strengthened by:\n\n\n\n- well-planned, regular careers events that broaden pupils’ understanding of routes and opportunities\n\n- high-quality senior pathway evenings which engage families in planning informed next steps\n\n- S6 leadership pathways, including the DYW S6 Ambassador Programme, offering authentic opportunities for leadership and service\n\n- BGE destinations planning, providing early identification and support for pupils’ interests and aspirations\n\n- personalised senior destination guidance, ensuring young people are exceptionally well supported as they move towards positive post-school pathways\n\n\n\nThe school’s Pupil Voice Improvement Team contributes meaningfully to school improvement, working alongside staff to co-design DYW and meta-skills initiatives. Regular and purposeful pupil-voice cycles ensure young people play a central role in shaping their experiences.  The young people shared school action plan with parents and partners in the Business Breakfast, May 2024.\n\n\n\nSenior and BGE pupils gain valuable insight through high-quality employer engagement, apprenticeship input and work-based learning experiences, significantly strengthening positive destination outcomes. S6 leadership pathways further enhance this, giving young people meaningful roles across the school and contributing to a strong culture of empowerment.\n\n\n\nThe school cafe, which opened in 2024, exemplifies the school's commitment to providing authentic work-based learning and leadership opportunities. The café operates under the supervision of staff volunteers but is primarily run by S6 pupils. Through this initiative, students actively manage and staff the cafe, with many completing their Barista qualification. This practical experience allows pupils to practice essential meta-skills such as communication, problem-solving, and customer service in a real-world setting. Crucially, the initiative fosters leadership development, teamwork, and accountability, significantly enhancing the students' readiness for positive post-school pathways.\n\nFind Your Inspiration is our school-developed programme which offers targeted skills development for senior phase pupils during the exam leave period, ensuring productive and enriching use of their time. The initiative is built upon community partnerships with local businesses, including Eden Mill and Gavin Mill, alongside professional input from SDS workshops and First Aid certification. This combination provides authentic, high-value opportunities that tangibly enhance pupils' employability and life skills.\n\n\n\nThe school’s commitment to accountability and reflective practice is evident in its monthly KPI reporting to the local authority, which provides clear, detailed evidence of the activity, reach and impact of all DYW workstreams.\n\n\n\nPartnership working is a particular strength. The school makes highly effective use of its extensive parent database (introduced in 2024), connecting parental professional expertise directly to school events, curriculum design and careers opportunities. The school’s growing alumni network further enhances opportunities for learners, with former pupils—through initiatives such as Graduate Appreciation—regularly returning to share their journeys, enrich the curriculum and raise aspirations.\n\n[https://www.canva.com/design/DAG4A68kAVk/0iljeEWbVHJgtIUyUs8ufQ/view?utm_content=DAG4A68kAVk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hce54ab4bf8](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG4A68kAVk/0iljeEWbVHJgtIUyUs8ufQ/view?utm_content=DAG4A68kAVk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hce54ab4bf8)",

        "so_what_text": "The work undertaken is not simply about providing opportunities; it is about ensuring that every young person develops the skills, confidence and ambition needed to thrive in an ever-changing world.\n\nWe believe that young people benefit from a highly coherent skills curriculum that allows them to talk with fluency about the meta-skills they are developing and how these apply to learning, future study and employment. This means that pupils across the BGE and Senior Phase are skilled at articulating their strengths, can plan their next steps with confidence, and are better prepared for interviews, applications and transitions. As a result, pupils are more motivated, more self-aware and more aspirational.\n\nOur effective use of employer partnerships and its extensive parent and alumni networks mean pupils gain authentic insight into the world of work, including labour-market trends, pathways, apprenticeships and routes into industry. We hope this results in pupils making better-informed subject choices, selecting pathways that align with their interests, strengths and career ambitions. Engagement in these experiences enhances pupils’ resilience, communication and teamwork, contributing meaningfully to improved positive-destination outcomes.\n\nThe personalised approach to senior destinations planning ensures that pupils receive timely, targeted and meaningful support, particularly those at risk of disengagement or uncertain about next steps. \n\nS6 leadership pathways, including the DYW Ambassador Programme, mean young people take on valuable, influential roles across the school. This leads to increased confidence, improved interpersonal skills, and stronger contributions to the wider school community. Young people develop a strong sense of responsibility and belonging, which directly enhances the school’s positive ethos and culture.\n\nRegular use of pupil voice structures ensures that change is shaped with young people rather than for them. This results in high levels of engagement, ownership and motivation. Pupils report feeling valued, heard and empowered, which has a positive impact on wellbeing, attendance and engagement with learning.\n\nMeta-skills passports used in some departments and digital badges provide pupils with clear, visible evidence of their progress, enhancing self-reflection and enabling them to demonstrate their skills to employers, colleges and universities. \n\nFor staff, the school’s consistent, strategic CLPL offer has resulted in increased confidence and shared language around meta-skills and DYW. This improves the quality of learning, teaching and assessment and contributes to a dynamic, forward-thinking professional culture.\n\nOverall, the impact of this work is substantial. Young people at Bearsden Academy are exceptionally well prepared for their futures, equipped with the skills, experiences and attributes needed to be successful, responsible and adaptable citizens. The school’s approach ensures that every pupil has access to high-quality opportunities that prepare them for life beyond school. ",

Post covid the staff team critically reflected on the need to rebalance and re-focus on BGE moderation across the school post-pandemic. This was a crucial, responsive leadership decision to ensure the rigour and shared understanding of standards.  \n\nThe success of the moderation strategy is fundamentally driven by a clear leadership structure and a commitment to collective accountability.\n\n- Moderation Working Group—comprising Principal Teachers (PTs) and teaching staff from across various curriculum areas—was established to ensure the framework was practical, relevant, and embedded.\n\n- Role of Principal Teachers (PTs): PTs were designated as the key drivers of implementation within their respective faculties. Their accountability was reinforced by:\n\n- Leading departmental moderation tasks (M1, M2).\n\n- Bringing evidence of Literacy and Numeracy standards to leadership conferences (Jan 2025).\n\n- Being responsible for uploading and reviewing evidence on the shared digital platform (Teams).\n\n\n\nWhole-School Accountability: Moderation was positioned as a non-negotiable component of departmental self-evaluation and improvement planning. Successive conferences and deadlines ensured every member of teaching staff (all staff involved in moderation across the school) was required to engage in the moderation cycle (Plan, Assess, Moderate, Evaluate), securing true whole-school involvement.\n\nTransparent Collaboration and Evidence-Informed Refinement\n\n- Shared Digital Platform: All moderation evidence, including completed moderation templates and pupil work, was uploaded onto a dedicated Teams page accessible to all staff. This promoted transparency and facilitated peer review across faculties.\n\n- Critical Cross-School Reflection (Post-Round 1): Following the first moderation task, all staff came together to reflect critically on the process, share emergent best practice, and identify common challenges (e.g., inconsistency in feedback quality).\n\n- Best Practice Resource Development: The Moderation Working Group analysed the evidence submitted to the Teams page to produce a best practice resource (a summary of findings) which highlighted effective approaches to planning and feedback. This resource was shared with all staff prior to Round 2.\n\n \n\nContinuing Professional Learning (CPL) and Autonomy\n\n- Integrated CLPL via Staff Conferences: Dedicated conference time for PT’s and then all staff in 24-25 [Moderation Pupil Feedback for Staff](https://glowscotland-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/ed010pliddle_glow_sch_uk/EYHvXaxkdlVLjd8cOZBhHM8B0dxZUs7-tJwtJMt9p6-j6w?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D)\n\n- Further CLPL for staff available in August 2025 – CLPL Cafe\n\n/\n\n- Targeted Task Autonomy (Round 2): For Moderation Task 2, departments were given autonomy to select the focus area most relevant to their needs: either curriculum moderation (evaluating a BGE unit) or Level 3 Literacy.\n\n- Responsive CPL Design: The submissions and feedback from Round 2 clearly demonstrated a critical request across the school for further Literacy support to build staff confidence and professional understanding in supporting literacy across all subjects.\n\n- Cascaded Support: The school responded immediately by tasking the English department to design and deliver targeted CPL. The English department successfully cascaded their knowledge and expertise in literacy standards, ensuring a consistent and highly informed approach to literacy across the school. This model exemplified effective internal capacity building and responsive support.\n\nThe moderation strategy is shifting practice towards a culture of using Moderation as part of department self-evaluation to improve learning and teaching.

This work aligns directly with national expectations for Outdoor Learning in Scottish Education and remains a key strategic priority for the school.\n\nOver the past five years, Outdoor Learning has grown from a small working group to a whole-school approach supported by staff, pupils and partners. The establishment of an Outdoor Learning Working Group and the introduction of S6 Outdoor Learning Ambassadors has ensured strong pupil leadership and sustainability. Our Pupil Improvement Team provides strategic direction, and staff access planned CLPL annually to strengthen pedagogy, confidence and consistency across the school.\n\nOutdoor Learning is now embedded within almost all departments, with departments taking responsibility for planned experiences and clear accountability for delivery.  Our outdoor garden continues to grow as a learning and wellbeing space.\n\nEngagement with families and our wider community has been central to our success. Events such as the Parent and Business Breakfast have showcased learners’ outdoor projects, strengthened partnerships and promoted shared ownership of our outdoor learning approach. This has been particularly impactful in building understanding of how outdoor experiences enhance resilience, creativity and confidence.\n\nThrough our partnership with Learning Through Landscapes Bearsden Academy been identified as a model of best practice, and a formal case study is currently being developed to highlight Bearsden Academy’s innovative and sector-leading approach. This recognition affirms our direction of travel and the high quality of learning taking place across our school.\n\nWe have strengthened inclusion through targeted outdoor curriculum support, particularly within our ELR provision, using outdoor spaces and resources to promote engagement, wellbeing and skills development for young people who benefit from alternative learning environments. Staff have been provided with outdoor learning boxes and replenished resources to remove barriers and ensure readiness to deliver meaningful experiences at any time.\n\nOutdoor Learning Week has become a highlight of our school calendar.

This results in a potential of reduction of pass rates, but overall higher levels of success and progression for young people. \n\nBearsden Academy consistently outperforms its Virtual Comparator in Breadth and Depth, indicating that learners are benefiting from the mixture of presentation policy and interventions to allow success and progress. Additionally, the school adds further value versus the Virtual Comparator when compared to schools with similar levels of attainment and similar VC values (e.g. Williamwood High school, Mearns Castle).\n\nPresentation policy has been adapted over the last 8 years from a focus on level change (e.g. National 5 to National 5) to additionally (e.g. potential of delivery of units, or National 4)  to intervention focused work (identifying multiple approaches to deliver a pass). \n\n\n\nThe process also changed from a paper-based “level change” procedure to a collegiate discussion focus. Principal Teachers meet with a lead Senior Leader to discuss progress of all learners at risk of underperforming. This isn’t carried out just using tracking data, but by taking into account what teachers are seeing, learner conversations and the view of the Guidance and Leadership team.\n\nThe meetings occur prior to prelims (October) and again after prelims (February). This allows interventions to be staged over the session.\n\n",
